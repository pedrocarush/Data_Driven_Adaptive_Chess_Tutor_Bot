This was my first attempt at pre-processing openly available lichess databases (PGN files), for ML purposes. 

The scripts have many hardcoded paths that need to be changed and the code is a bit of a spaghetti mess, but it should work for prototyping something.

Important: some scripts do use bash shell commands so, if using Windows, they should be ran inside WSL and/or after replacing those commands with Windows-compatible ones.
